## Bash vs Zsh

- Bash is the default one.
- While bash is a perfectly functional shell; zsh offers some improvements: security, auto-completion etc.

### Reasons to consider switching from bash to zsh

#### Auto-completion and recent directories

`cd src/2018/projects/newProject` equals to `z newProject` after visiting that directory at least once with `cd`

#### Command option display

In zsh if you type the command e.g. `ls -` (with `-`) and then hit tab, zsh will display the options along with short descriptions

#### Typing error correction

If you make a typo, rather than just display `error: command not found`, zsh will try to interpret what you tried to type.

Z shell is case insensitive.

#### Color highlighting

`zsh` will differentiate the directories and files by adding color highlighting to directories. Additionally, the font-weight will be slightly bolder.

#### Command-click URLs

With zsh, you can just hit the command key, then click on the URL.
