I really enjoy every one of keynotes, they're lightweight and can be watched any time.

### Most Fav ones:

["Performance Matters" by Emery Berger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A&t=7s) Mind blowing talk, it felt like matrix. Presents 2 systems: *Stabilizer* is a tool that enables statistically sound performance evaluation, making it possible to understand the impact of optimizations and conclude things like the fact that the -O2 and -O3 optimization levels are indistinguishable from noise. *Coz* is a new "causal profiler" that lets programmers optimize for throughput or latency, and which pinpoints and accurately predicts the impact of optimizations.

["Finding bugs without running or even looking at code" by Jay Parlar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvNRlE4E9QQ) Check this free [alloytool source](http://alloytools.org/) This is really cool.

> Tools called "model checkers" can be used to model and analyze the architecture/design of a system. Model checkers can simulate every possible sequence of operations your system might ever encounter, and check if desired properties always hold. And if a property doesn't hold, the model checker will show you an exact sequences of operations that violates it.

["Typing the Untyped: Soundness in Gradual Type Systems" by Ben Weissmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJHD2xyv7xo&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCToXJZ4Uk1NVW70U3C-Im-&index=5) great examinations of tradeoffs between soundness (catching as many errors as possible) and completeness (not rejecting valid programs) that fundamentally impact the usability and usefulness of the type system.

["Correctness proofs of distributed systems with Isabelle" by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w4KC6i9Yac&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCToXJZ4Uk1NVW70U3C-Im-&index=30) `Only mathematical proof, e.g. by induction, can cover an infinite state space.` This talk introduces Isabelle/HOL, an interactive proof assistant that can be used to formally prove the correctness of algorithms. It is somewhat like a programming language and REPL for proofs.


Couple of other interesting talks:
- ["Uptime 15,364 days - The Computers of Voyager" by Aaron Cummings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H62hZJVqs2o&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCToXJZ4Uk1NVW70U3C-Im-&index=21)
- ["ASTRIAGraph: Monitoring Global Traffic in Space!" by Moriba Jah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbotVEb200&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCToXJZ4Uk1NVW70U3C-Im-&index=22)
- Imogen Heap's talk, couldn't find it in strangeloop channel but to get the gist check this [hide & seek peformance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExuhF-_heus)

There were lots of them, haven't watched most of them though but check playlist above.
