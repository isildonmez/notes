### Introduction

We’ve talked about the client-side and the server-side but how do we keep ahold of all our user’s data? Who remembers that your login password is CatLover1985 so you can sign into the website? The bottom layer of any web application is the database and it handles all the remembering for you (we’ll cover caching much later). It can be relatively simple, like an excel spreadsheet, or incredibly complex and split into many giant pieces like Facebook’s.

Compared to a normal programming language like you’ve already learned, SQL (Structured Query Language), which is used to query databases, is a very simple syntax… there are only a small handful of verbs to learn. What trips people up is that you need to be able to visualize in your head what it’s going to be doing.
