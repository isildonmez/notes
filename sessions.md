Cookies are important because they enable you to have a single continuous “session” while you’re interacting with a website. It means you only have to log in once instead of for every single request (which you probably experienced from a broken website at some point in the late 90’s).

Your browser includes all the cookies that a particular website has set along with its normal request and the server uses those strings to figure out which user you are and whether you are logged in, what your settings are (like if you’ve set up viewing preferences) and things like that. It’s also why, when you clear cookies from your browser history, everything seems to get wiped out and go back to the default.

It’s also how some ads seem to follow you from one website to another – another name for them is “tracking cookies”.
